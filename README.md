# HR Dashboard

The dashboard is divided into two primary views — Summary View for overall HR metrics and trends, and Employee Records View for detailed employee data exploration.

   2. Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.
   3. Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.
   4. Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)
   5. Show the distribution of employees by city and state.

   Demographics: 
   The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including:
   1. Present the gender ratio in the company.
   2. Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
   3. Show the total number of employees within each age group.
   4. Show the total number of employees within each education level.
   5. Present the correlation between employees’s educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.

   Income: 
   The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:
